Been thinking of blogging out my experiences in gamedev, specifically in regards to the game production process.
It also doesn't have to specifically be about gamedev but can also include general experiences like school, events, etc...

Might also consider writing about games that I've played/am currently playing as an exercise in analysing them, primarily in aspects such as game design or the game narrative.
