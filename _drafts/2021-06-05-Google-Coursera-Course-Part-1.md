Recently, as a means of improving my knowledge at Project Management, I've started working on the Google Project Management: Professional Certificate. This post reflects my learnings from the first part of the course. The courses themselves are broken up into various "weeks", with each week covering a different topic focus.  

Week 1: Project Management Basics  
This section went over general keywords and definitions, along with the course's objectives and a long list of keywords one might see in job postings and desired skills.  

Google's definition of a Project Manager is they should have:
- Excellent time management, prioritization, and organizational skills
- Demostrated ability to lead others
- Outstanding communication skills
- Successful track record in coordinating the work of internal and external teams to develop new products
