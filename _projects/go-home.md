## Description

Go Home! is a game developed for **Ludum Dare 46** - Theme: "*Keep It Alive*".  
It was developed over 1 weekend as part of the Ludum Dare game jam.  

Players take the role of a guy who's had too much of people breaking the pandemic lock-down and spreading the infection.  
Get them to stay home the only way you know how.  
By yelling in their faces until their comply!

## Main Responsibilities

As the sole developer I was in-charge of programming, designing and creating art for the game.
